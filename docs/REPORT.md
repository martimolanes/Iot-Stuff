# Scalable Weather Station for ESP32 with DHT11


## Introduction

This project represents a comprehensive exploration into the realm of IoT, integrating hardware, software, and networking components to create a flexible and deployable solution for weather monitoring. The core components of the system include an ESP32 microcontroller, temperature and humidity sensors (DHT22/DHT11), RFIC RC522 sensor,an MQTT broker server, and a self-made web server. These elements work in concert to collect real-time environmental data, analyze it, and make it visible to end users via a web interface. Furthermore, the project has advanced features such as RFID authentication, enabling enhanced security and control over access to the weather station.
